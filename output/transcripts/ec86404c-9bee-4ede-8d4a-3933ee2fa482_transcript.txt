[00:04] Alex: Hey, Jessica. I know, right? I've been good. Just swamped with work. How about you?
[00:12] Jessica: Same here. I was actually thinking we should grab lunch sometime this week if you're free.
[00:16] Alex: Yeah, that sounds great. How about Thursday?
[00:20] Jessica: Thursday works. Noon?
[00:22] Alex: Perfect. Should we meet at that place near your office? What's it called? Green Fork.
[00:28] Jessica: Yep, that's the one. Their grain bowls are amazing.
[00:32] Alex: You and your grain bowls. All right. Thursday at noon at Green Fork.
[00:36] Jessica: Awesome. I'll text you just to confirm. Gotta run now. Call coming in.
